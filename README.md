# stock_prediction

#### Gather historical data of a stock, organize it into training and test sets, and train a model to predict its closing prices.

I chose 4 stocks – Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Disney – as well as Bitcoin, and made a model for each one. The models were trained on 75% of the corresponding stock's closing price data, and tested on the remainder. The models were made, trained, and tested in stock_prediction.py, the test data was saved there as well, which can be found in the model_data folder. 
And, the test data was visualized using stock_app.py.
