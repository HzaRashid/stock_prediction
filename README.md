# stock_prediction

#### Gather historical data of a stock, organize it into training and test sets, and train a model to predict its closing prices.

I chose 4 stocks – Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Disney – as well as Bitcoin, and made a model for each one. The models were trained on 75% of the corresponding stock's closing price data, and tested on the remainder. The models were made, trained, and tested in [stock_prediction.py](https://github.com/HzaRashid/stock_prediction/blob/main/stock_prediction.py), the test data was saved there as well, which can be found in the [model_data](https://github.com/HzaRashid/stock_prediction/tree/main/model_data) folder. The test data was visualized using [stock_app.py](https://github.com/HzaRashid/stock_prediction/blob/main/stock_app.py).
